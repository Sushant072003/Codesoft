# CODESOFT-Intership-Projects  

This repository was created to submit the projects which was given by 'CODESOFT' for a Data Science internship.  

- Project_1 - Titanic_Passengers_Survival_Prediction  
    In this project I have build the predictive machine learning model ðŸ“Š which predicts the survival of passengers from Titanic disaster. ðŸš¢  

    I have try to answer the following questions after analyzing this dataset.  

    Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (age, gender, class.. etc)  
    What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?  
    Where did the passengers come from?  
    Who was alone and who was with family?  
    What factors helped someone survive the sinking?  
    How accurately we can predict the survival of the passenger?
    
- Project_2 - Movie Rating Prediction With Python  
    Every dataset has a story and this set is pulled from IMDb.com of all the Indian movies on the platform.
    We will going to do some exploratory data analysis to answer the below questions.

    Year with best rating
    Does length of movie have any impact with the rating?  
    Top 10 movies according to rating per year and overall.  
    Which director directed the most movies  
    Which actor starred in the most movies  
    After that, we'll build the predictive machine learning model using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor which is going to predicts the rating of a movie based on the given parameters.
