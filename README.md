# CODESOFT-Intership-Projects    

This repository was created to submit the projects which was given by 'CODESOFT' for a Data Science internship.   

<b>1. Iris Dataset Analysis:</b>
        - I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to understand the relationships between features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.    
        - I used Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize data patterns and distributions.  
        - The goal was to analyze the dataset and identify how the features contribute to classifying the Iris flower species.  


  <b>2. Movie Rating Prediction:</b>  
        - I built a machine learning model to predict movie ratings based on features like genre, director, and actors.    
        - The process involved data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying regression techniques to historical movie data.    
        - This project provided insights into factors influencing movie ratings and demonstrated how to use machine learning to make accurate predictions.  
       
<b>3. Titanic Survival Prediction:</b>  
        - I worked on the Titanic dataset to predict whether passengers survived based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.    
        - I implemented preprocessing techniques, feature selection, and a classification model to make predictions.    
        - The project involved analyzing patterns and creating a model to determine survival probabilities.
